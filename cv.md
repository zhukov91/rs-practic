# About me:
Good afternoon! I love working, and I like the dynamics of progress in programming. I am a person who likes perfectionism, so I try to do my job as efficiently as possible. I like programming, and I try to devote 2-3 hours to it every day.

I try to develop every day by pumping my skill. I hope that soon I will become a good programmer, because it's cool!

# Skills:
- Html, 
- CSS, 
- Js(basic knowledge)
- Basic knowledge: OPP
- VCS: Git

# Code examples:

```
var number = 1234;
var quantity = 0;

for (var i = number; i >= 1; i /= 10)
    {
        quantity++;
    }
  console.log(quantity);
``` 
```
function zeros (n) {
  let zero = 0;
  for (let i = 5; i <= n; i *= 5) {
      if (n >= i) zero += Math.trunc(n / i);
  }
  return zero;
}
```
```
function expanded_form(int $n): string {
	$count = strlen($n);
	$sum = (string) $n;
    for($i = 0; $i < $count; $i++) {
   		if($sum{$i} == 0 ) continue;
    	$return .= intval($sum{$i}*pow(10,$count - $i - 1)) . " + ";
    }
  $return = rtrim($return, " +");
  return $return;
}
